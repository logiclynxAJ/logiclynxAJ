- 👋 Hi, I’m @logiclynxAJ
- 👀 I’m interested in developing cutting-edge Mobile Apps using Flutter, creating dynamic Web Apps with ReactJs and NextJS, and programming in versatile languages such as Golang, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Dart.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Golang, machine learning algorithms, and cloud services (AWS/GCP).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, particularly those aimed at social good or technological innovation.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can send me an email at me@aryak.dev or connect with me on LinkedIn [Aryakumar Jha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/devaryakjha/).
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/His
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm an avid fan of mind-bending sci-fi shows and superhero movies. When not immersed in thrilling narratives, I love wandering in nature, especially finding tranquility while sitting by the beach.
